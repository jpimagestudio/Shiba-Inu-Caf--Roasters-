        <p>「The Topographic, Geological, and Mineral Map of Taiwan under the Empire of Japan (commonly referred to as the Topographic General Map by the Government-General of Taiwan) is a map series compiled by the Japanese Government-General between 1936 and 1944. Created at a scale of 1:50,000, the maps document the topography, geological features, and mineral resources of the entire island of Taiwan at that time, offering detailed representations of its geographic characteristics and natural resources.</p>
        <p>This map series was the most precise and comprehensive of its time. It represents a significant outcome of the Japanese Government-General’s efforts during the colonial period to survey and develop Taiwan's geological resources. Beyond marking natural features such as mountains, rivers, roads, railways, towns, and villages, the maps also document geological strata, structural formations, and mineral deposit distributions. As such, they played a crucial role in geological research and mineral exploitation efforts in Taiwan during that era.
